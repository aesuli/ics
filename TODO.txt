TODO
- text search in browse and code
    * extend to all browsing modes
- labeling from table views
- automatic DB creation
- use ids rather than names in batch jobs
- user authorization profiles
- cleaning
    * purge unreferenced documents
    * periodically clean download directory
- check for sql/js/etc code injection
- other tools:
    * terminology extraction
- versioning
- backup of deleted data
- twitter integration
- richer classifier info
    * estimated accuracy
- templates (mako)
- store source of classification (which user?)

TOMONITOR
- strip input strings

DONE
